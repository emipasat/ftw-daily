      <h2>2.	Scope of Epic Visits Services</h2>
      <p>
      Through the “Platform”, we (Epic Visits and its affiliate (distribution) partners) provide an online “Platform” through which “Accommodation” and/or “Experiences”   “Providers ” – in their professional conduct of business (i.e. B2C or B2B) – can market, sell, promote their services for order, purchase, reservation, rent, and through which relevant “Visitors”  of the “Platform” can discover, search, compare, and make an order, reservation, purchase or payment. By making a booking, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the “Provider” with which you make a reservation or purchase a service (as applicable). From the point at which you make your Reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the Provider. The Epic Visits “Platform” (owned and administrated by Epic Visits SRL) offers an online tool through which the “Providers ”  can promote “Accommodations”  and “Experiences”   and “Visitors”  can discover them, look for them, order them. 
The Epic Visits “Platform” is an online curated marketplace that enables registered and verified “Members” (“Providers”) to publish “Accommodations”  and “Experiences”  Services on the  Epic Visits “Platform” and to communicate and transact directly with “Visitors”  that are seeking to book such services ().Services may include the offering of vacation or other properties for use ("Accommodation"), single or multi-day activities in various categories (“Experiences” ), access to unique locations. “Providers” alone are responsible for their services. When “Visitors” make a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with the “Provider”.  Epic Visits is in contractual relationship only with the “Providers ”, curating the “Accommodations” and “Experiences” , the contractual relationship does not imply that our “Platform” is or will become a real estate broker or insurer.
When rendering our listings, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by “Providers”. Each accommodation and experience is verified by a representative of Epic Visits team before listing, as such, the “Providers”  that market and promote their “Accommodations”  and/or “Experiences”  on the “Platform” are given access to our systems and through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates/fees/prices, availability, policies & conditions and other relevant information which is displayed on our “Platform”. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our service, we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our “Platform” or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each “Provider” remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates/fees/prices, policies & conditions and availability) displayed on our “Platform”. Our “Platform” does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification or (star) rating, type of accommodation of any Provider (or its facilities, venue, vehicles, (main or ancillary) products or services) made available, save as explicitly indicated or set out otherwise.
Our “Platform” is made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, reservations, tickets, products or services available on our “Platform” for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.
While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, and we curate each accommodation and experience before listing, , Epic Visits has no control over reservation or stay of the “Visitors”, the truth or accuracy of the information  during the stay of the “Visitor”, the performance or conduct of any “Provider” or the quality of an “Experience” or “Accommodation”. Any references to a “Provider” being verified indicate that the “Provider” has completed a relevant verification or identification process has been personally visited by a member of our team for eligibility criteria before listing. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation, participate in an Experience, accept a booking request from a Visitor, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. 
If you choose to use “Platform” as a “Provider”, your relationship with Epic Visits is limited to a contractual relationship as a partner, and not an employee, agent, joint venture of Epic Visits for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of Epic Visits. Epic Visits does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under these Terms specifically, including in connection with your provision of the services. You acknowledge that every listing you want to make will be checked by a member of Epic Visits team, and based on the eligibility criteria, you may/may not be eligible for listing. 
The promoted “Experiences” are based on the information which the Service Provider sends us. Therefore, the Provider promoting their “Accommodations”  and “Experiences”  through our “Platform” gets access to our systems through which they become exclusively responsible for the update of the prices/taxes information, availability, conditions and politics or any other relevant information which is published on our “Platform”. Although we pay special attention to the “Accommodations”  and “Experiences”  promoted by the “Providers”  on our “Platform”, we will not verify if or guarantee that all information is precise, complete or correct and we will not be held responsible for any error (including typographical errors or other evident error), any interruption (whether it’s due to temporary failure and/or partial, reparations, updates or support of our “Platform” or others), for inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-disclosure of information. We curate each space before listing, the “Provider” is held responsible for the accuracy, integrity or fairness of the information (descriptive), including prices/taxes, availability or other politics and conditions presented on our “Platform”. Our “Platform” does not form and should not be seen as a total guarantor of the promoted services’ quality, even though we try to provide a high level of those. Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices.
